This is some of my work
Many problems are not complete
Most solutions are original
Some are taken from other sources
Implementing the code of others helps me understand it better
Most work
Some dont

()
(())                 ()()
(())() ()(()) ((())) ()()() (()()) 

(())()                       ()(())                        ()()()               (()())
((())()) (())()() ()(())()   (()(())) ()(())() ()()(())     ()()()() (()()())   ()(()()) (()())() ((()()))
                                        (()(())())
possible alterations:

curr + ()
() + curr
(curr)

special cases 
1   ()x n
    ()x n + 1, (()x n)
2   () + (..)
    (() + (..)), ()() + (..)
