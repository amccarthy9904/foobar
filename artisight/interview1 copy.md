Here are 10 behavioral/cultural interview questions you might be asked during your interview for the Senior Full Stack Engineer position at Artisight, Inc., along with suggested responses tailored to the role and company culture:

Describe a time when you had to solve a complex technical problem. How did you approach it, and what was the outcome?
Vino:
    Situation : Morpheus does not maintain server names. if you take a server out of a cluster and put it back in, it will have a different name than before
    Task : I was asked to pull server data from morphesu and upload it to a service called Vino, for it to then be pulled for internal use. Morpheus was on a private cloud. Vino was more open to internal access but could still access Morpheus
    Action : vino did not support raw JSON storage. for every env, region, cluster and server, i had to walk the JSON tree and upload each element individually, unless it was a list of lists. Thenn i had to make a list of dictionaries where the value of every dictionary in the list was the value of the original list. the keys were generated with ~~~ and an iter variable. When pulling data for a particular server i had to get data for the env, cluster, region, and server, refactor it back into the origingla json from by finding all my keys and reverting the lists of dicts back into a list of lists and then mergeing all 4 jsons before printing it for the user.
    The amout of data in Vino made it too slow to be reasonably used. 
    Result: I figured out i could store then entire json element for every entity as a single string, this could easily be re-jsonified before being merged and presented to the use with the built in python json library
